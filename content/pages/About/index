<p>Hello there!</p>

<p><strong>I'm Martin D&oslash;rum Nygaard</strong>, or <em>mort</em> as you may know me from the internet. I am a 16 year old guy from Norway.</p>

<p>Since you've found your way here, chances are I already know you. If so, say hi in the reply section :3 No need to sign up.</p>

<p>Anyways. This is my blog, my little corner of the internet. An area where I can write about whatever comes by my mind. And it's all mine &gt;:D</p>

<p><strong>I'm a programmer.</strong> As my <a href="https://github.com/mortie?tab=repositories">GitHub page</a> suggests, I program. My favourite language is Javascript (not to be confused with Java), though i do a wee bit of C++ too. The languages PHP, Python, HTML and CSS are also in my repertoire. This is why most of my blog posts are computer related; I love computers.</p>

<p><strong>I'm a drummer.</strong> Started drumming some time in 2011. At least if you consider playing drums on Guitar Hero "drumming" :P</p>

<p>A month or so before the summer holiday in 2012, I got my first real drum set. It was a fairly basic electronic drum kit, a Roland HD-1. It did the job for a while though. Earlier this year however, in April, I got a real acoustic drum set, a used one off of the website <a href="http://finn.no">finn.no</a>. I hope to some day play in a band. If you play an instrument, and live in the Oslo area, feel free to contact me!</p>

<p><strong>I'm an Open Redstone Engineers administrator.</strong> Open Redstone Engineers, or ORE for short, is a network revolving around the redstone-aspect of the game Minecraft. For you who don't know, Minecraft's redstone is kind of like a computer electronics environment - you build gates like XOR gates, AND gates, IMPLIES gates, etc. All the gates you may know from computer science. Out of those gates, we build all kinds of crazy stuff like adders, CPUs, computers, etc. Sounds really nerdy, and I guess it is. It's fun though.</p>

<p>I and a few internet friends started ORE some time back, and I'm the host for two of the servers. We got:
<ul>
	<li>main server: mc.openredstone.org</li>
	<li>school server: sc.openredstone.org</li>
	<li>survival server: ss.openredstone.org</li>
	<li>website: <a href="http://openredstone.org">openredstone.org</a></li>
	<li>YouTube channel: <a href="http://youtube.com/user/openredstone">youtube.com/user/openredstone</a></li>
</ul>
Have a look - there's no whitelist ;) You can't build unless you're member though, which you get by applying.
For more information, have a look at <a href="http://mortie.org/?p=159">my blog post about ORE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'm a youtuber.</strong> Well, kind of. I've got a <a href="http://youtube.com/user/greenjalapenjo">youtube channel called greenJalapenjo</a>, where I mostly upload redstone related videos. Honeslty though, it's got far less videos than I'd like.</p>

<p><strong>I'm a blogger.</strong> Well duh.</p>
