<p>Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if you could go up to 10 seconds into the past, undoing all actions by yourself and others in that time?</p>
<p>Have you ever sat down in the dark, all by yourself, asking what would happen if you suddenly were to be transformed into a green ball?</p>
<p>What about those late nights you&#8217;ve been awake, not being able to sleep because you&#8217;ve wondered how it&#8217;d be to be trapped in a seemingly endless, uniform cave, full of pits of some kind of bright red goo, possibly lava? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve asked yourself these questions, multiple times. At least some of them. And with good reason; these questions are rooted deep down the oldest, most primitive parts of our brains, the parts which we have inherited from the reptiles we once evolved away from. The parts of our brains left from our past, the cause for our primitive fears and thoughts, and even questions. </p>
<p>You see, in the dawn of time, being transformed into a ball was a quite real possibility, and rewinding time wasn&#8217;t all that rare either. Being trapped in a seemingly endless cave full of dangers was quite common at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of 48 hours, I set out on a mission to recreate that ancient fear, to please our need to experience lost times. Our craving to remember what has never been. Our attraction to the unknown, the things yet to be explored, the things our ancestors from the start of time and space itself experienced. </p>
<p>How do you recreate that, you may ask. I know I did at least. I asked myself, how can I, a mere mortal, satisfy this ancient need to remember what has never been, what has yet to come and what may never even exist?</p>
<p>The answer lies in two words, and two words only. Quite possibly the most powerful two words ever to be pronounced by man. The holiest of words to ever traverse the Earth. Time Ball.</p>
<p>Time Ball is a game in which you are a ball, whizzing through time and space itself, through an endless cave full of dangers and challenges. It is your duty, your call in life, to do the impossible, to reach the end of the endless cave. It up to you to beat the universe itself, to do the impossible, to explore &#8211; and exceed &#8211; the limits of the human race. </p>
<p>You are given one ability to help you on your impossible, never ending mission. You can tear the fabric of space and time apart. You can see what no ball has ever seen, you can walk where no form of life has walked before. You control time. </p>
<p>Your ability isn&#8217;t what it once was, however. Long ago, in the Age before Time itself existed, you were the most powerful of creatures. You had full control of space and time. However, as time formed, and space with it, your abilities started to degenerate. You shrank down, transformed into a ball. You went from having all of time and space in your hands. You suffered extreme losses. </p>
<p>What is left of you now, however much less than it once was, is still exceedingly powerful however, at least to any earthling it would seem that way. You see, you are granted the power to turn back time, albeit only up to 10 seconds. Using this power, and your ability to whirr around at groundbreaking speeds, you may actually have a chance at beating impossibility, and completing the endless journey.</p>
<p>There is only one problem. You have been in hibernation for so painfully long. Because of this, you don&#8217;t even remember how to move properly anymore, and your reaction time is severely degraded. You will therefore fail. You will most definitely fail. However, every time you fail, you can turn time back to the beginning of your journey and start anew, and slowly, oh so slowly, you will pick up speed. Your reaction time will increase again, eventually even outgrowing what it was when you were all those ages ago. Your confidence in your aptitude will rise, and you will once again speed through space, eventually learning to turn the time back that split second before you die, giving you just enough time to react to the danger ahead.</p>
