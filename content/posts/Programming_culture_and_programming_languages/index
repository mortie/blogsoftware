<p>Experienced programmers tend to have quite strong opinions on programming languages. Therefore, they are an important aspect of nerd culture. Different cults don't simply have different programming languages of choice. It goes much, much deeper than that; not only do they have different languages of choice, they also have forbidden languages. I, for one, am part of a programming "cult". Cult being a Skype chat sprawling with life, and nerds everywhere. In our little community, there are certain rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>C is awesome.</li>
	<li>C++ is legal, and one of the better languages. Some consider it as awesome as C, others think the OOP part of it goes over board.</li>
	<li>Never, ever, ever, ever, ever use Lua.</li>
	<li>Java is horrible.</li>
	<li>JavaScript is okay (after all, the web is built on it), but you should preferably be working with C/C++.</li>
	<li>DirectX is horrible and should never have existed. OpenGL is the way to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on, but that's a selection of some norms.</p>

<p>In other communities, you can find people who exclusively use Lua, or think Java is the way of the future.</p>

<h2>The question is, why is language such an important part in nerd culture?</h2>
<p>This is an important question. After all, it'd very much make sense if programmers thought more in the lines of "the tool isn't important, it's how you use it that counts". This is obviously not the case though, at least for many (maybe the vast majority?) of programmers.</p>

<p>I myself have witnessed - and participated in - fairly violent discussions, so called flamewars, where bad words are thrown around constantly, simply over differences in programming language preference.</p>

<h2>You are what you eat</h2>
<p>As a programmer, what language you use is a huge part of your identity. You get intimate with the language, and as time progress, you learn it in and out. You learn to live with - and appreciate - it's quirks, and you're so familiar with it's syntax you would write code in your sleep. Literally. Chances are you've dreamt about writing code in your favorite language during the night. It's ways of doing things quickly becomes the only reasonable way to do things. Everyone should understand that, and when you see languages which does things in a way you're not used to, you see them off as moronic.</p>

<p>By ourselves, we programmers are fairly harmless. Put us together though, and things starts happening. There are two major possible turns of events:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>We agree on our language preferences.</strong>
We then proceed to socialize and talk about how amazing our language of choice is, and how stupid other languages are. If we're a group that are put together, we may start a skype group, and bond with each other.</li>
	<li><strong>We disagree on what language is best. This is where all hell breaks loose.
</strong>Have you ever seen one of those flame wars on the internet, where two groups of people hate on each other over a comment section? Well, imagine that, just person to person. Things can get nasty. Very nasty.</li>
